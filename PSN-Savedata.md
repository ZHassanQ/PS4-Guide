# PSN ID
## 🌐 Fake PSN ID

1. Select **"User Tools"** menu.
2. Select **"Activate PS4 Accounts"**
- By default the local account will be activated with an auto-generated account-id value.

## 🌐 Real PSN ID

To activate an account offline, go to the `User Tools` menu, and select Activate PS4 Accounts. By default the local account will be activated with an auto-generated account-id value. This default account value can be edited using the on-screen keyboard.

- How to know your PSN ID?
    - Simply copy any savedata from your account to your USB Flash Drive. It will create a directory like this: `X:PS4\SAVEDATA\PSN_ACC_ID\CUSAXXXXX`

# Savedata 
## 💾 Encrypted

- Make sure the savedata you have match the **"Title_ID"** of the game you own. (If not read this **[section](#-region-change)**)
- For example your Game ID = `XXXXX01010` then the savedata you want to copy `XXXXX01010`

1. Put the savedata in your USB Flash like this `USB:PS4/SAVEDATA/YOUR_PSN_ID/"Savedata Folder"`
