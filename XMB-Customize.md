## Profile Picture

If you want to replace your profile picture, then you need to have a `512x512` picture. And then copy it to your PS4 in any directory. (Preferably `data\PS4Xplorer`) After that launch PS4Xplorer and go to your picture and set it as a profile picture.

- If you haven't already installed it go to **[PKG-Installation.md](https://github.com/ZHassanQ/PS4-Guide/blob/main/PKG-Installation.md)** to see how to install PKG-files in many different ways, and what to do if an there are an errors.


## Shortcuts

If you want a fast shortcuts to Debug Settings, activating GoldHEN (ESP version is also included), storage, and more! In your notifications then install this **[PKG-file]()**.

- Note: You need to launch a payload for the notifications to work, I suggest "Payload Guest" app.
    - When you install the notifications shortcuts, it will install a payload that can be immediately launched.
