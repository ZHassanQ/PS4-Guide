# IN MAINTENANCE DONT USE, COME SOON!
# PS4 Complete Guide!

This repository contains a complete guide on how to install HEN (Hombrew ENabler) on your PlayStation 4 and everything to do with it. If you're in 9.00 you need to have a USB Flash Drive and an Internet Connection, and if you're on 5.05 you don't need any external components or anything just an Internet Connection to a website that can be either self hosted or visited if hosted.

## Up-to-Date?

Every single file of this guide links to the repository release's. And every single file was downloaded from the original source. If you want check if there's any outdated files, simply go to releases and all links will either redirect you to the original source or a section where the original source link is written in a word. (If you found out an outdated app, pull a request for others)

### Last Check

- HEN Guide: Up-to-date for 5.05 and 9.00
- Installation: Cannot be outdated.
- Modify: Cannot be outdated, if there's any more, easier or advanced modifying i will try to cover it.
- Patches: Cannot be outdated, if there's any more, easier or advanced patches i will try to cover it.
- Customize: Cannot be outdated, if there's any more, easier or advanced customizing i will try to cover it.
- Online Services (PSN): Sadly still there's no way to connect to PSN services without updating to the latest firmware.
    - Note: I am aware of saving a flash dump, so you can update and revert later. But these methods use soldering which will not be covered.
